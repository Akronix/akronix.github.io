I don't exagerate if I say that this year has been the most intense year of my life.

A lot of travelling, a lot of emotions and realizations and a lot of adventures have taken place:

- **[FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/)**. My first congress. I really had a good time and got to know many interesting projects and nice people. Free software is not dead!

- **[Hack the Earth in Calafou](https://calafou.org/en/content/hackeja-terra-2018-giving-back-hacking-people)**. Get to know  breaking projects like calafou and _ruralhacking_ being experimented in reality was very inspiring.

- **Spanish ecovillages gathering**. A yearly gathering of ecovillages and all the projects and people related to them. Very inspiring, but still not my present or short them future.

- **Summer congresses**. First, it was the [Wikimedia Hackathon](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Hackathon_2018/Program#Saturday_19_May_2018), in Barcelona, where [I presented WikiChron for first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX1ZVh1k2nw). The hackathon was very well organized and I enjoyed my time there. Also, I had some time to spend visiting Barcelona with a friend, I even had the very lucky opportunity to enter in Casa Milà, _La Pedrera_, for free! :smile: thanks to a friend of my friend :heart:. Then, it was ECIS, in Porsmouth, and later on, OpenSym in Paris in which we presented [our academic work using WikiChron](/publications.html#collaboration).

- **Ecotopia Biketour**. The [Ecotopia Biketour](https://www.ecotopiabiketour.net) was a turning point in my life. I spent all the summer holidays I had there. I found many people like-minded and realized that my future isn't the academic world but something closer to the nature, and my latest plans were not going in that direction. Still uncertain and exciting in what the future will materialize that.

- **[Spanish Hackmeeting 2018](https://es.hackmeeting.org/hm/index.php?title=Hackmeeting2018)**. My second hackmeeting, but this time actually going to the place with my backpack in my shoulder specifically for it, giving a talk and sleeping there; the full hackmeeting experience! Unfortunately I got sick during the meeting (I often try to do more things than what my body can support) :sweat_smile:.

- **[Trustroots](https://www.trustroots.org/about)**. I joined the [Iberian Collective](https://ideas.trustroots.org/2018/08/27/iberian-collective/) and I was volunteering twice for two long weekends in the beach of Lepe, Huelva at the Trustroots house. I met really nice people there and we all share that Trustroots has an incredible potential, [the collective was a big impulse to the network](https://ideas.trustroots.org/2018/12/15/meta-wiki-developers/). Hope one day, it becomes as powerful and supportive as it can be.

- **House on the mountain**. And the last week of the year, from 22th to 30th of December, I've been living a kinda of a dreamy life in a countryside house in the Navarra mountains.
My soul definitely belongs to that environment and every try I make in that direction just keep confirming it. This experience has brought other questions, as well as happy and melancholic moments.
I'm still digesting all of that. But what it is sure is that I will never forget what I lived those days up in that house on the mountain.

Apart from the previously mentioned, this year I visited the following places: Toledo, Brussels, Switzerland (Geneva, Laussane and Zurich), Hervás, Sevilla, Vitoria, Coimbra, Bilbao, Huelva and Málaga.

In addition to that, of course, I have enjoyed a lot to work and have fun in my two communal gardens where I grow most of my food. Plus, all the other outdoors activities towards to a free and coherent way of living: debittering olives, picking fruits, asparagus, mushrooms and chestnuts, growing different vegetables,... as well as indoor ones like making my own preserves and homemade sauces.

For sure I'm forgetting many things more. But, as you can see, this has been a very very intense year.

To make the final of the year even more epic, yesterday, 31st of December of 2018, my most notable contribution to Trustroots, [the search for users feature, got merged into the git master hunk](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/pull/965) :tada:. Soon, it will be up at [trustroots.org](https://www.trustroots.org/).

As well, yesterday, Bicipark got launched in its beta version :smiley:. I just added it to the projects section, [check it out!]((/projects.html#BiciPark)).

The next year looks promising. I have many exciting plans to do. I'm gonna leave apart the master for a while and finish my contract by April to enjoy &mdash;paraphrasing Alexander Supertramp, May 1992&mdash; _"ultimate freedom"_ for a while.

In the work side, I want to write some insightful findings around the sustanibility of online collaborative communities. Also, I want to get WikiChron to a very high level of potential.

In the free time side, I want to push BiciPark to a level I feel comfortable with, I'll be doing this as part of the [CUSL contest](www.concursosoftwarelibre.org/) (Spanish only). Read more and write more as well.
My body needs atention too, so I want to do more sport and pick up my climbing hobby.

In the hacker side, I think I will reach the 1000 contributions made in the last year in [Github](https://github.com/Akronix/) at some point and maybe reach 1k reputation in [my stackoverflow account](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2904315/akronix).

And then, travel, meet places, meet people and _find my place_.

My dreams continue growing and becoming more real. I hope yours too.

Start making them real, and one day they will be. Don't accept consumer products which pretend to fool you with empty *pseudo-*happiness. Search for **real happiness**.

Happy 2019!
