So today is a bit more of three weeks since I got back "home" from my two-months trip in the very north.
I wanted to write a blog post about all my experiences and adventures, but it becomes too much to sit down and write down sooo many things (this only post has taken me time from 3 different days to finish it up).

## The trip

The trip starts the 19th of December 2019 in Copenhaguen and ends the 18th of February in Madrid.

The farthest north I got was Alta (Norway), only 250km far from Nordkapp, the northernmost ([or almost northernmost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Cape_(Norway)#Geography)) point of Europe. My aim was to get to Nordkapp, but the road was closed by avalanches, the boat was too expensive and I was getting already too much homesick and blue mood by the lack of sunlight.

For next time, I will try to make it more like a "logbook" with a small note for each day, or to split different topics in smaller posts. I think that way looks less discouraging to write and more enjoyable to share with others.


## The "logmap"

However, I did put down a map of the journey with all the stops I did and all the "means of transport" that I used: [Press here to open the map](https://facilmap.org/St2yjcRmp4a2).

The stops are classified in: Short stay (1 night) -> orange house, medium stay (2-3 nights) -> yellow house and long stay (>3 nights) -> red house. Among all the stops, I only paid one night in a camping in a very remote spot in the north of Norway (near Alta). The rest I was mostly staying at some friend's place or, specially in the "long stays" in some kind of project / community. Additionally, two days I had to sleep in a "public space", one time in the surroundings of Berlin and another time in the train station of Laxå (Sweden).

The transport is classified in hitchhiking, bus, train and mixed. As you can see, hitchhiking is my preferred way of traveling, specially once I left the very dark Scandinavia and I got to Europe mainland. I met very nice people hitchhiking and it helped me a lot to better meet the local culture. It was particularly special the hitchhiking journey I did with a fellow hitchhiker from Wurzen (near Leipzing, Germany) to Vienna (her) & Bratislava (me).

## Viaggiare è il mio peccato

I want to do a bit of story telling, so I can give you a little sample of how my trip looked like :smiley:.

The most outstanding anecdote with transport I can remember happened in Italy. I was in Venice just before Carnaval, where I got to by hitchhiking from Slovenia, but not without struggle and with some desperation involved. I already spent more days than I planned there in Venice because I was having a good time and I was being very well hosted by an Albanian family, but I wanted to get to France soon because the trip was getting too long already. I was aware that **hitchhiking in Italy is a challenging quest**, so I decided to rent a car from Milano to France by a very cheap offer I found in [driiveme](https://www.driiveme.co.uk/).

But, haha, things could not be so easy. Something went _"wrong"_ with the booking of the car and I only had the chance to get a reimbursable car for <100€. With such quantity, no company would rent me a car to cross the border and leave the car in the other side, so I would be stuck in Italy just like the other blablacar passengers that were supposed to go with me in the car.

I texted the Italian girl who was coming with me in the car and explained the situation. And then, something happened.
She offered me to go to hers friend birthday's party, *en la campaña* (in the countryside) and sleep there. Great deal! Somehow I ended up "hitchhiking" a party, speaking spanish with nice Italian people in the middle of Piedmont and hanging out until late :tada:.

Next day I brought over this Italian girl to the train station of Genoa, left the car in the airport and start asking the people who were waiting for a flight coming from Paris if they were going anywhere direction west. No one could take me, so I did a long walk (mixed with a bit of jogging when I "hitchhiked" a runner going towards the national road, where I was heading to :laughing:) up to a petrol station where I was trying hard to hitchhike **any** car.

Nobody stops in Italy, but they sometimes need to fill the car tank with fuel. By asking a family in the petrol station I got a short ride some kilometers further west near the toll entrance. There, I waited for hours...and hours :cold_sweat:. Eventually, it got dark and my hopes were getting down. I started to think that I wouldn't make it for France another day again and that I'd have to sleep in Italy. But I put on my reflective jacket and kept on trying.

Finally, one car stopped. Guess who??? The only person who stopped for me in Italy was a man whom I had asked before in Genoa airport if he were going direction west. He said that normally he would go directly from the airport to Savona and happily take me, but this time he had to go first to Genoa Hospital so he couldn't...And I'm not too sure if it's something relevat to add, but this only person was not really Italian, but of French origin :fr:.

In the whole day I only manage to do 60km by hitchhiking and I still had another 350km upfront to get to my stop for that night (Marseille). It was dark and getting late, so I was kind of giving up hitchhiking and asked to my driver to drop me off in the Savona train station. From there, there was still only one flix bus going to Marseille. I had an hour until the bus would come so, as I like to do, I didn't buy the ticket straightforward and left some time for improvisation. When I got to the train station, I did a quick check to the bin and shortly after one Italian man approached me. He wanted to know if I was a traveler, how I got there, where I was sleeping,... everything! Apparently he always wanted to do this kind of trips but he never got the courage to do it. The time passed and it was time for me to catch the bus if I wanted to get to Marseille that night. I went ahead to the Flixbus website willing to buy the ticket and...surprise! 50€ for a 350km ride! No way, I won't pay that much.

The bus came. I begged the driver for a free ride or a discount. It didn't work.

So I went back to my Italian little fan boy and accepted from him a ride with his family to their hometown, a small village called Loano only 30km further west. At that time, hitchhiking in the road would be _**equal**_ to sleep in the road and, needless to say, there was no any transport going from the little village of Loano to France. So, I kindly asked this family to drop me off in a petrol station inside the highway which goes to France. At least, I thought, in the petrol station I can talk directly with the people and passed the night protected from the cold if everything goes unlucky.

It was like this: I put on my two feet in the petrol station, rapidly said goodbye to my fellow Italian guy and walk some steps to the nearby parking area. First car, a French number plate!! let's ask!

> Oh, you are full, I see. No problem. _Thank you and bon voyage!_

Next car, another French!!! ask!

> Where am I going? Je _aller_ à Marseille. Quoi ? Nice ? Parfait!!

Wow! so It took me hours and hours to just move a scarce amount of 80km within Italy, and few minutes to get a ride to France! I love Italy, but definitely it isn't the most friendly country for hitchhikers :sweat:.

Ok, but Nice is still 200km far from Marseille and there's someone waiting for me in there, someone who's got to wake up tomorrow early to go to work. So I thought that it was time to take a more reliable mean of transport.

I couldn't make it on time for the next cheap flix bus Nice - Marseille. It was a time crunch, but I could make it for the last train from Nice to Marseille. The driver had to hurry a bit up, dropped me near a tram stop, I run to the tram stop just in time to catch the next tram direction to the train station and, finally, I got into the train. I hadn't even time to buy the train ticket in the train station, and I wouldn't have bought the ticket in the tram in case I missed the train plus missed the money of the ticket. Some security men, just done with the work of the day, came over where I was sitting down, sat down nearby and started to chat with the security men of the train. I joined the chat and pretended everything was normal. The tickets inspector passed several times in the journey, but never asked me for the ticket! :v:[^1].

Very lucky and adventure day! And, even better, I spent near 0€ in the journey from Milano to Marseille!

[^1]: It seems to me that the inspector would rather go after black people, so it might be a case of racism.

## Feelings and reflections during the trip

Now I'd like to share some of my reflections and feelings during and after this trip.

* Surprisingly, even for me as well, I got a bit tired of so much adventure...and specially to be doing it alone. I'd rather go with someone else or with a group for next trip.

* Being a guest is nice, but also made me feel I don't have my "own" space. Sometimes you feel it's like you are taking things from others.

* I missed my gardens and eating from them :cry:.

* Having a community living and a agroecological project is not very compatible with living as a digital nomad.

* When you travel, you meet a lot of new people and different cultures. You get many exciting new connections but they are young and ephemeral if you are moving all the time. In this trip, at some point I have missed having some closed friend around. Also, for coming trips I want to try to stay longer in places so I can develop my friend connections further, getting to know the culture deeper and really feel as part of the place.

* The thing I hate the most from hitchhiking is to be breathing so much cars pollution for a fairly long time. I hate this so much to the extent that it makes me to rethink if I'll do another hitchhiking trip anytime soon.

* At times, I have missed to be more in the nature. It was healing to stay in the countryside some days after I was in Marseille and I inhaled very polluted air when hitchhiking in Fos-Sur-Mer.


Of course, there are many good experiences and positive learnings. Even re-new excitement to meet other parts of the world. But I also considered these downsides while traveling this time...maybe I need a break?

I want to take this opportunity to also **thank all the people** who, in one way or another, have helped me along the journey. It's really hopeful to experience how people can be so helpful benevolently :heart::heart::heart:.

## Coming back to the real world

Now, since I arrived to Madrid, I feel burden by all the things that I wanted to get done as fast as possible; curiously mixed with other times of plain boredom, where I feel a lack of motivation and loneliness.

I really feel like moving on, still living in this flat in Madrid feels like stagnation. But I have very good fellow party friends (big up dubmilia!) in Madrid and being involved in eXtinction Rebellion Madrid is something meaningful for me. Also, I know I'll be craving stability very soon in order to get the end of my master in good terms.

Maybe the mountains of Madrid is not a bad option after all? :thinking:
