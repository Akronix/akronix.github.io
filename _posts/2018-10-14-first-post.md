After a lot of time lacking and frustration I finally started a blog. I don't know how persistent I'm gonna be. Hopefully, this doesn't die after a week. But I can't promise :man_shrugging:.

But, I do think I have reached a point where I have some things to shout out to the world. Geek stuff, curiosities, dreams and personal things too. I hope I make a sense out of all of this.
I'm gonna write in english or spanish indifferently. Spanish is my mother tongue and there are some things that I prefer to express in Spanish, but also I understand that English is the _de facto_ the international language nowadays, and, besides, my programming projects are in english.

Stay tunned! :radio:
