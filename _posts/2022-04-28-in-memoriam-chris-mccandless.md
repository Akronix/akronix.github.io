[Today, 28th of April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_McCandless#Alaska) is the 30th anniversary since Christopher McCandless, alias Alexander Supertramp, decided to abandon civilization and go to live _into the wild_ until his last days. I want to remember his boldness and determination to leave society and follow his call to find "absolute freedom".

As a premonitory fact, today I'm leaving Madrid to go for adventures in smaller villages and communities, where nature prevail over the rule of the big city. Thirty years after, here there's a successor.

Rest in peace.
