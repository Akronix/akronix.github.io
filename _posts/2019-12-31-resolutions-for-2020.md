[In the blog post I wrote exactly one year ago](http://www.akronix.es/old-and-new-years.html), I said 2019 was the most intense year of my life. However, this year I had even more travelling than last year, more intense emotions and many many adventures...So maybe this year has been even more intense than last year! :tada: I wonder, though, how much I could keep this growing rate up :thinking_face:.

And still the last adventure of this year is yet to come. I'm currently writing from a cafe in Sweden, somewhere between Stockholm and Gothenburg. I came here to celebrate NYE in a different way: In a few hours I'll join a group of hippies down in the woods, in a Scandinavian gathering known as "Ting". It's been three years since I first heard about Rainbow gatherings and, after two missed chances to join one of them in the last two years, it's funny that I will join first the Scandinavian version of it :sweat_smile:.

Reading the personal goals I stated last year, I can say that I have fullfiled quite very well the travelling one and the meeting new people one, a lot of good experiences here!. In the hacker side, I achieved the goal to reach the 1k contributions in Github in the last year and I did too got to 1k reputation in stackoverflow. Looking backwards, the work side was probably too ambitious with regard to the publications in communities sustanibility, but I did push WikiChron to a very good level of potential and usability (still missing the last release with last additions for WikiChron monowiki, sorry about that [@Javiag](https://github.com/javiag)!). And well about Bicipark...Sadly I should admit that I haven't spent the amount of time and effort that it needed :shrug:.

But probably the most important point is the one about: _Finding my place_. I'm afraid to say that this will be a fundamental point still missing for 2020. I've thought about many places where to live this year: from la ZAD in France, to very disntant and unexpected places like Albania, or more familiar places like Almería (Sunseed). My decision to keep doing the master, the search for a community I would fit in and other whims of fate have led to that none of them have worked out.

I love travelling and it it has brought me a lot, but I have the feeling that I can't build and focus on as much the thigs that would make me happy (as well as focus on my studies and [professional future](http://www.akronix.es/professional-future.html)) when I'm travelling. Last months, weeks and days I have thinking much about my next place, specially since the situation in my home has turned out unbearable. So this is why for this year, one big resolution is to find my place. A place to move and to feel like home for some time. Perhaps up in the mountains of Madrid? or maybe somewhere near Barcelona? maybe in a community in the countryside in Cataluña or Málaga Should I wait for others to join me, should I go and join others' community or should I just focus on my studies until I'm done and look for somewhere later on? Well, right now, I'm very confused really of where I should be and how it should be...

What I do know is that a community lifestyle is what I have been craving in the last two-three years and that more and more other kind of life is artificial and difficult for me. So, however it will be and wherever I am, for me the most important thing is that I feel like I live in a community.

Every new year is a new chance to make changes and changes trigger creativity, variety and new opportunities. It's also a chance to look back and set the course for the future.

Let's set the course the best we can direction to **aliveness** and **happiness**. Until the next port. Do you want to jump in?

Steady, ready, go 2020!
