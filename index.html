	  <h3>I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>.</h3>
	  <h3>I am a Data &amp; Computer Scientist, among many others things. Figuring out how to harmonically combine this skill with protecting both nature and humankind. My aim is to become a <strong><i>"naturalist data scientist"</i></strong>, if that can make sense anyhow 😅</h3>
	  <h3>For me, computer technologies should be no other than a <strong>tool</strong> that serve the needs of <strong>communities</strong>.</h3>
	  <h3>Currently, I'm working as a Data Engineerer at <a href="https://www.bibio.org/">Bibio.org</a>, in Granollers, Barcelona.</h3>
	  <h3> I'm also working on my personal project, <a href="https://druidnet.es/">DruidNet</a>, everytime I get a bit of time.</h3>
	  <h3>Previously, I worked at <a href="http://www.ipe.csic.es/">IPE (Ecology Pyrenean Institute)</a>, part of <a href="https://www.csic.es/">CSIC</a>, for a research project about the influence of droughts in trees. I was cleaning, processing and visualizing data; in particular, <a href="https://github.com/akronix/treenetproc"> I improved a library in R to clean data from dendrometers</a>.
	  <h3>Prior to that, I worked at the <a href="https://ucm.es">University Complutense of Madrid</a>, as an asistant researcher, and my job was about data analysis and data visualization of collaborative online communities. I developed an online visualization tool, <a href="https://wikichron.science/">WikiChron</a>, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}publications.html">published some research papers</a>.</h3>
	  <h3>I also like to write. If you are curious, you can have a look at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}blog.html">my blog</a> or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}stories.html">my short stories</a> (mostly in Spanish).</h3>
	  <h3>Other topics of my interests are: ecology, gardening, handcrafting, commmunity living, traveling, cycling, hiking, sustainability,...<br/>
