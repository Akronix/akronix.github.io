	  <h3>I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>.</h3>
	  <h3>I am a Data &amp; Computer Scientist, among many others things. Figuring out how to harmonically combine this skill with protecting both nature and humankind. My aim is to become a <strong>"naturalist data scientist"</strong>, if that can make sense anyhow ðŸ˜…</h3>
	  <h3>For me, computer technologies should be no other than a <strong>tool</strong> that serve the needs of <strong>communities</strong>.</h3>
	  <h3>Previously, I was working at the <a href="https://ucm.es">University Complutense of Madrid</a> as an asistant researcher and my job was about data analysis and data visualization of collaborative online communities. You can see my published research papers in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}publications.html">the publications section</a>.</h3>
	  <h3>If you are curious, you can also have a look at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}tools.html">my toolbox</a>.</h3>
	  <h3>Other topics of my interests are: ecology, gardening, handcrafting, poetry, commmunity living, traveling, cycling, hiking, sustainability,...<br/>
	  <em>(Disclaimer: This list is a non-exhaustive one ;D) </em></h3>
