	  <h3>I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>.</h3>
	  <h3>I am a Computer Scientist, <em>among many others things</em>.</h3>
	  <h3>For me, computer technologies should be no more than a tool that serve the needs of a community.</h3>
	  <h3><em><u>Currently, I'm unemployed and traveling around the world.</u></em><br/>
	  Before, I was working at the <a href="https://ucm.es">University Complutense of Madrid</a> as an asistant researcher and my job was about data analysis and data visualization of collaborative online communities. You can see my published research papers in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}publications.html">the publications section</a>.</h3>
	  <h3>I participate in several online and offline <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}communities.html">communities</a> and I enjoy working on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}projects.html">my personal projects</a>.</h3>
	  <h3>If you are curious, you can also have a look at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}tools.html">my toolbox</a>.</h3>
	  <h3>
		Finally, I'm currently enrolled in a Master of Data Science by the <a href="http://uoc.edu">UOC</a>.<br/>
	  </h3>
	  <h3>Other topics of my interests are: gardening, nutrition, cooking, handcrafting, poetry, commmunity living, reading, cycling, sustainability,...<br/>
