	  <h3>I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>.</h3>
	  <h3>I am a Data &amp; Computer Scientist, among many others things. Figuring out how to harmonically combine this skill with protecting both nature and humankind. My aim is to become a <strong>"naturalist data scientist"</strong>, if that can make sense anyhow ðŸ˜…</h3>
	  <h3>For me, computer technologies should be no other than a <strong>tool</strong> that serve the needs of <strong>communities</strong>.</h3>
	  <h3>Currently, I'm working in my personal project (DruidNet), traveling around, sailing and looking for a nice community to pass the winter</h3>
	  <h3>Previously, I was working at <a href="http://www.ipe.csic.es/">IPE (Ecology Pyrenean Institute)</a>, part of <a href="https://www.csic.es/">CSIC</a>, for a research project about the influence of droughts in trees, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology">dendrochronology</a> data.</h3>
	  <h3>Prior to that, I was working at the <a href="https://ucm.es">University Complutense of Madrid</a> as an asistant researcher and my job was about data analysis and data visualization of collaborative online communities. You can see my published research papers in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}publications.html">the publications section</a>.</h3>
	  <h3>If you are curious, you can also have a look at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}tools.html">my toolbox</a>.</h3>
	  <h3>Other topics of my interests are: ecology, gardening, handcrafting, poetry, commmunity living, traveling, cycling, hiking, sustainability,...<br/>
