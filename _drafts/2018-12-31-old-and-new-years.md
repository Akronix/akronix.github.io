I don't exagerate if I say that this year has been the most intense year of my life.
A lot of travelling, a lot of emotions and realizations and a lot of plans have taken place.

- FOSDEM.

- Summer congresses.

- Biketour.

- Hackmeeting 2018.

- Trustroots

- House mountain.

To make the final of the year even more epic, today my most notable contribution to Trustroots, [the search for users feature, got merged into the git master hunk](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/pull/965) :tada:. Soon, it will be up at trustroots.org.

As well, today, Bicipark got launched in its beta version :smiley:. I just added it to the projects section, [check it out!]((/projects.html#BiciPark)).

The next year looks promising. I have many ideas to do. I'm gonna leave apart the master for a while and finish my contract by the end of april to enjoy real freedom for some time.

My dreams continue growing and becoming more real. I hope yours too.

Start making them real, and one day they will be. Don't accept consumer products which pretend to fool you with empty *pseudo-*happiness. Search for ***real happiness***.

Happy 2019!
