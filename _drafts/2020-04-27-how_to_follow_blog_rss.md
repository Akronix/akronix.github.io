Today I am writting a brief, "technical", post about how you can follow my blog, and, actually, any blog that supports RSS / Atom[^1] (presumably, any blog on the internet does it). These technologies generate a file with the information about the latest content updates of the website which, in turn, allow external programs to fetch those updates and notify the user about those changes.

In fact, if you go to [my personal site ending with /atom.xml](/atom.xml) or [with /feed.xml](/feed.xml), you will see those files are already there.

But if you click the previous links, you will see a not-very-human-friendly file. The idea is to give this link to what is called a "feed reader", which will, somehow, prompt you when an update has been made to this blog. So, here there are some feed readers you can use in different format and platforms:

- **Telegram**: This is the one I use. So, if you use Telegram, simply go and [contact "Feed Reader Bot"](https://telegram.me/TheFeedReaderBot) and give it the comand: `/add https://www.akronix.es/atom.xml`. This bot can also watch and notify you about updates in Twitter accounts, facebook pages, etc. You can read more in [their website](http://thefeedreaderbot.com/).
- **Browser**: Browsers used to have built-in support of RSS feeds. Back in the days, liked the live bookmark feature in Firefox. So I used to clicked every now and then that bookmark of the website I liked from the bookmark bars and see if there was any update or new content over there. Now, this feature is removed from the core of Firefox, but you can still use an extensions like ["LiveMarks"](https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/) which do a similar job.
- **Other options**: See Wikipedia comparison: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators

Choose the one which suits you the best and give it the atom link or the feed.xml one, and don't miss out any of my new entries! :smiley:
