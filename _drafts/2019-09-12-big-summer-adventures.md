<s>I'm writing this post</s> I started writing this post from the airplane which will take "Centacleta" (my loved bike) and me back home from Dublin.

This is the end of a more-than-2-months long travel. In this long journey, I've visited 7 countries (France, UK, Southern Ireland, Albania, Montenegro, Croatia and Austria); I've cycled more than one thousand and five hundred kilometers, from northern Spain (San Sebasti√°n) to Dublin (joining to ecotopia in Glasgow and going together until Belfast); and hitchhiked another one thousand four hundred kilometers, from Tirana (Albania) to Vienna (Austria).

Traveling is a very inspiring experience. Looking at different lifestyles, cultures, people and landscapes brings you new ideas of the outside world. But also, it is a good way to introspective of your deep inner dreams that you are actually looking after.

Ecotopia life-changing again,
Looking forward for future. Still undecided...
